# EEG-processing
This repository contains codes for data collection and processing of multichannel EEG in matlab. The included pipeline consist of epoch devision baseline removal averaging noise removal and independent component analysis with topographic visualization
Topographic representation of acitivation of EEG electrodes:
[IC_activity_blink (1).pdf](https://github.com/Anne-Andresen/EEG-processing/files/7739035/IC_activity_blink.1.pdf)
where a high activation in the front was indicative of an eye-blink

result of the processing pipeline was presented like the following

The entirety of the processing pipeline is in matlab 

Feel free to start an issue if problems with the codes occur, then I will be happy to help. 
Please do cite if my codes are used.
